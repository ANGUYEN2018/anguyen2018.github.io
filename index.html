	    	Born in Savannah, GA, a city representative of the expression, "The Deep, Dirty South," I was raised by two immigrants parents who had met through the chaos of history. My mother was born to a small farming family deep in the rural parts of Vietnam, whereas my father was a city boy raised by an affluent family. Chaos plagued my parents' young lives at the time as the Vietnam War ended. My mother's father, a high-ranking military official, was forced into a reeducation camp--disrupting how my grandmother, my mother, and her siblings had to live their lives. As for my father, he escaped overnight as bullets flew like the shooting stars from above to Malaysia--he was what you'd call the Boat People.

				<p>
				With every ray of hope, some positive reality will occur, and for my parents, it meant passage to the Americas. My grandfather's release and his family's passage was sponsored by a small Baptist church growing in Savannah, GA, while my father and two of his brothers found their own way to the East Coast of the States after two years in Malaysia. As fate would have it, my parents would meet. My father was a small time manager at the local quail egg factory and he hired my mother, one of her younger sisters, and one of her younger brothers. With nail salons being a fad amongst the Vietnamese community at the time, my parents wed and opened one the year before my birth.
				</p>

				<p>
				And so I was born that year after the salon was opened. We lived with my grandparents for quite sometime before I started school, so my grandmother was my primary caretaker and mentor as my parents worked their daily and nightly hours to make ends meet. The streets of the ghetto were dangerous where we lived during time, so I was kept busy with coloring books.
				</p>

				<p>
				Eventually, I started preschool and my parents were able to purchase their own home. On a daily basis, I sat in this back room of the nail salon, which till this day I considered my own personal prison with no windows and three channels playing in the background--showing soap operas during the day and adult sitcoms during the night. At times, I chose to run free in the open salon only to witness from time to time a customer, whose boyfriend is usually at the local, neighboring bar, fling fans and curse words at my parents as they try blame my parents of false mistakes in hopes of gaining something free. I'd run back into my prison praying, because that's what my Catholic education taught me to do in times of fear.
				</p>

				<p>
				It was all that bad though. I was young, so all I needed was my imagination and freedom to make what was seemingly valuable use of my time. I recall playing with the chemicals and lotions and mixing them together, while my parents were not watching. Those soap operas were not completely irrelevant to my childlike mind as I used them to generate my own fictious stories that I told to the polite, old customers as they sat in their pedicure chairs. It was a different kind of playground that you wouldn't find most kids exploring, but it was my kind of playground.
				</p>

				<p>
				Time flew by, and before I knew it, I had another person to love in my life: my younger brother. I didn't want my younger brother to go through the same things, so until I learned to drive, I begged my parents to just take us directly home after a day of school, and I'd take care of him. They agreed and gave me the opportunity to learn how to be an adult. I spent my days watching my brother grow as my parents worked their long hours--I taught him how to bathe himself, potty trained him, helped with homework, taught him how to ride a bike, and cooked his meals. I wasn't just a caretaker. I wanted to do more than that by helping my younger brother mature, and so I encouraged all questions, for him to find his own independence, and to dream big dreams--I gave him no bounds.
				</p>

				<p>
				All of my life, I attended private, Catholic school. From preschool to middle school, it was the same school where I sat at the top of the my peers in academics. As I entered high school, a private, Catholic, all-boys, military school, my ego was taken down from my high horse. The environment was different than your usual school, but nonetheless, I enjoyed it, from the military training to the fraternity-esque banter--I loved it all.
				</p>

				<p>
				A few summers ago, the one before my senior year of high school, I attended a summer program and my group leader was a Cal graduate. I learned a lot about myself that summer and grew out of my shell. Also, I was lost as to where I wanted to go after high school, but that group leader encouraged me to take a chance and apply to UC Berkeley and now here I am.

                        	Longing for their homeland, a group of immigrant Vietnamese students at UC Berkeley joined forces and created the Vietnamese Student Association in 1979. Their goal was to create a space in which they could connect through their similar backgrounds and share their culture with each other. To further their purpose, they looked to educate others about Vietnamese culture, history, and heritage. Through their efforts they built a family away from home for Vietnamese and Vietnamese American students, a community that continues to grow. Today, Cal VSA is still a student organization that embraces our Vietnamese and Vietnamese American roots and culture. Though our members are a part of a new generation, we recognize and commemorate the experiences that our parents and relatives have had while also striving to identify and to understand the emerging narratives and current issues in our community.
